This is a Xamarin Bindings for [Google's CameraView library](https://github.com/google/cameraview)

The guys from React-Native decided to use an original library in their camera component,
but because the original library is not really supported anymore, they are using own fork.

Current Binding based on the fork from [React-Native Community](https://github.com/react-native-community/cameraview)
with support of Google Vision for Barcode detection, which can be found here [here](https://github.com/alexshikov/cameraview/tree/vision-detector)
